# Challenge Summary

***Quick Sort is an algorithm which implements recursively. And thus we need to add a base case for quickSort function..***

**Quick Sort algorithm follows Divide and Conquer approach. It divides elements into smaller parts based on some condition and performing the sort operations on those divided smaller parts.**

* pivot — the element of the array (in our case is the first element) which is compared with other elements in the same array.
* left — is an array that stores elements of the passed array which are less than the pivot.
* right — the same as left, but stores elements greater or equal to the pivot.

## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency

* I understood the problem domain

* I'm trying imagine the results 

* I'm trying to draw the visualization  on a white board then trying to writre the code and test it until it give me **passesd**



### test 

* npm run test
