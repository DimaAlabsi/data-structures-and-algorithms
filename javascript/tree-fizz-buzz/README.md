# Challenge Summary

Write a function called fizz buzz tree
Arguments: k-ary tree
Return: new k-ary tree
Determine whether or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both. Create a new tree with the same structure as the original, but the values modified as follows:

If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String

    ***Breadth first traversal iterates through the tree by going through each level of the tree node-by-node.***
    
## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency

* I understood the problem domain

* I'm trying imagine the results 

* I'm trying to draw the k-ary tree  on a white board then trying to writre the code and test it 
until it give me **passesd**

-----------------

### test 

* npm run test
* npm test fizzBuzzTree.test.js
