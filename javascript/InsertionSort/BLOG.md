# Challenge Summary

***Selection Sort
Selection Sort is a sorting algorithm that traverses the array multiple times as it slowly builds out the sorting sequence. The traversal keeps track of the minimum value and places it in the front of the array which should be incrementally sorted.***

## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency

* I understood the problem domain

* I'm trying imagine the results 

* I', trying to draw the visualization  on a white board then trying to writre the code and test it until it give me **passesd**



### test 

* npm run test
