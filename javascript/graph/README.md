# Graphs


A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.

Here is some common terminology used when working with Graphs:

Vertex - A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.
Edge - An edge is a connection between two nodes.
Neighbor - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.
Degree - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.
## Challenge


Implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list, and should include the following methods:

add node
Arguments: value
Returns: The added node
Add a node to the graph
add edge
Arguments: 2 nodes to be connected by the edge, weight (optional)
Returns: nothing
Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph
If specified, assign a weight to the edge
Both nodes should already be in the Graph
get nodes
Arguments: none
Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar)
get neighbors
Arguments: node
Returns a collection of edges connected to the given node
Include the weight of the connection in the returned collection
size
Arguments: none
Returns the total number of nodes in the graph


## Approach & Efficiency

* I understood the problem domain

* I'm trying imagine the results 

* I'm trying to draw the hash table on a white board then trying to writre the code and test it until it give me **passesd**
