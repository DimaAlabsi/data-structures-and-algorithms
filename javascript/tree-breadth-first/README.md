# Challenge Summary

* Write a function called breadth first
    * Arguments: tree
    * Return: list of all values in the tree, in the order they were encountered
    * NOTE: Traverse the input tree using a Breadth-first approach

    ***Breadth first traversal iterates through the tree by going through each level of the tree node-by-node.***

* Our output using breadth first traversal is now:

**Output: A, B, C, D, E, F**

## Whiteboard Process

------------------------------------


## Approach & Efficiency

* I understood the problem domain

* I'm trying imagine the results 

* I'm trying to draw the binary tree  on a white board then trying to writre the code and test it 
until it give me **passesd**

-----------------

### test 

* npm run test
* npm test breadthFirst.test.js
