# Trees

## Challenge
* Node
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.

* Binary Tree
Create a Binary Tree class
Define a method for each of the depth first traversals:
pre order
in order
post order which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.
Any exceptions or errors that come from your code should be semantic, capture-able errors. For example, rather than a default error thrown by your language, your code should raise/throw a custom, semantic error that describes what went wrong in calling the methods you wrote for this lab.

* Binary Search Tree
Create a Binary Search Tree class
This class should be a sub-class (or your languages equivalent) of the Binary Tree Class, with the following additional methods:
Add
Arguments: value
Return: nothing
Adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
Contains
Argument: value
Returns: boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.






## Approach & Efficiency

* I understood the problem domain

* I'm trying imagine the results 

* I', trying to draw the linked list on a white board then trying to writre the code and test it until it give me **passesd**
*


### test 

* npm run test

## API

post order which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.
Any exceptions or errors that come from your code should be semantic, capture-able errors. For example, rather than a default error thrown by your language, your code should raise/throw a custom, semantic error that describes what went wrong in calling the methods you wrote for this lab.

* Add

Adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
Contains
Argument: value
Returns: boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.

* Can successfully instantiate an empty tree
* Can successfully instantiate a tree with a single root node
* Can successfully add a left child and right child to a single root node
* Can successfully return a collection from a preorder traversal
* Can successfully return a collection from an inorder traversal
* Can successfully return a collection from a postorder traversal
