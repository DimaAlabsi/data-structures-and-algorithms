# Singly Linked List

* Data structure is that how we organize and structure our data at computer science.

* Data strucure is a programming methadology (way to solve prblems and things).

* Linked List >>> the fundemental for arrays.

## Challenge

**New Implementation**


### Node
* Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
### Linked List
* Create a Linked List class Within your Linked List class, include a head property.
* Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.
* The class should contain the following methods:
      * insert
            Arguments: value
          Returns: nothing
            Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
      * includes
          Arguments: value
        Returns: Boolean
           Indicates whether that value exists as a Node’s value somewhere within the list.
          * to string
               Arguments: none
                   Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
                             **"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"**

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
* I understood the problem domain

* I'm trying imagine the results 

* I', trying to draw the linked list on a white board then trying to writre the code and test it until it give me **passesd**


## API
 insert method : that takes a value and reurn nothing  Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance

 '* includes method :  that takes a value and return boolean  Indicates whether that value exists as a Node’s value somewhere within the list.

 * toString method : that takes none and Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:

   **"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"**
