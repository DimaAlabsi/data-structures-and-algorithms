## Approach & Efficiency


+ I search about method that returns the value of a number rounded to the nearest integer to get the middle index of the length of array 
 then I push every value that doesnot equal the middle index of the array  and if the index = middleNumber then push the new value..

 * Edge cases: null array & the first index undefined
