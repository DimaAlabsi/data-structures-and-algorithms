# Hashmap LEFT JOIN


* The SQL LEFT JOIN returns all rows from the left table, even if there are no matches in the right table. This means that if the ON clause matches 0 (zero) records in the right table; the join will still return a row in the result, but with NULL in each column from the right table.

This means that a left join returns all the values from the left table, plus matched values from the right table or NULL in case of no matching join predicate.


## Challenge

Write a function that LEFT JOINs two hashmaps into a single data structure.

Write a function called left join
Arguments: two hash maps
The first parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and a synonym of the key as values.
The second parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and antonyms of the key as values.
Return: The returned data structure that holds the results is up to you. It doesn‚Äôt need to exactly match the output below, so long as it achieves the LEFT JOIN logic



-----------------------

## Approach & Efficiency

* I understood the problem domain

* I'm trying imagine the results 

* I'm trying to draw the hash table on a white board then trying to writre the code and test it until it give me **passesd**



---------------------

## Solution üëç

### code

[code](/javascript/hashmap-left-join/hashmap-left-join.js)

Combine the key and corresponding values (if they exist) into a new data structure according to LEFT JOIN logic.
LEFT JOIN means all the values in the first hashmap are returned, and if values exist in the ‚Äúright‚Äù hashmap, they are appended to the result row.
If no values exist in the right hashmap, then some flavor of NULL should be appended to the result row.
